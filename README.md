# Algorithms

This repo is to document my working through Algorithms 4th Ed. by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

### Intention
The intention is to create a reference resource for my future self (and anyone else who cares to use it) on the
foundational forms used in computer science.

Builder Notes are intended to document the trials and tribulations of the process.  It takes the form of a log and
is best read in Patrick Stewart's voice doing a "Captian's Log - Stardate<xx.yy.zz>".

Builder Resource is a cheatsheet for helpful links.

Each section will ideally contain a mix of working sample code and plain-language description of what is being observed
and why/how it is significant.
